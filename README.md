have to add in the website--
1. Services: service purchase
7. Add two more routes. Relevant to your website. These two routes will be private
8. Add a 404 page (not found page)
9. Explore the [AOS package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aos) and implement it in the Homepage
10. Change the icon color when clicked and change it back when clicked again
11. There is still a problem- when logged in the logout button drops down automatically and the same happens with the logins when I logout
