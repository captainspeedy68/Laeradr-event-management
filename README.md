have to add in the website--
1. Services: services details, service purchase
2. organisers can take services and Attendees can join events by paying for tickets
3. Private routes- 
The service detail route will be a private/protected route- if the user is not logged in, the private route redirects to the login page.
4. After reloading the page of a private route, the user should not be redirected to the login page.    
6. Once logged in, the user name should appear on the header.
7. Add two more routes. Relevant to your website. These two routes will be private
8. Add a 404 page (not found page)
9. Explore the [AOS package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aos) and implement it in the Homepage
10. Change the icon color when clicked and change it back when clicked again
11. There is still a problem- when logged in the logout button drops down automatically and the same happens with the logins when I logout
12. When clicked else where in the page make the dropdown to the original hidden state
